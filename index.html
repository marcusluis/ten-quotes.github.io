          “Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to
          make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe
          exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is
          always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't
          just give up.”

          “From the fact that people are very different it follows that, if we
          treat them equally, the result must be inequality in their actual
          position, and that the only way to place them in an equal position
          would be to treat them differently. Equality before the law and
          material equality are therefore not only different but are in conflict
          with each other; and we can achieve either one or the other, but not
          both at the same time”

          Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space
        </p>
        <p>
          “Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it
          everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of,
          every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
          of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
          ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every
          hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every
          king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father,
          hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
          corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
          saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote
          of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
          <br /><br />
          The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the
          endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this
          pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other
          corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to
          kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of
          blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
          triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a
          dot.
          <br /><br />
          Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we
          have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this
          point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great
          enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there
          is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from
          ourselves.
          <br /><br />
          The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is
          nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could
          migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment
          the Earth is where we make our stand.
          <br /><br />
          It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
          experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
          human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
          underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
          and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
          ever known.”
